# Statistical modelling

One of the main reasons to make a differentiable kinetic model with enzax is to embed it inside a statistical model. This makes it possible to infer kinetic parameters from quantitative measurements and background information, opening a wide range of possible uses.

Enzax's aims to support applications beyond statistical modelling, such as optimisation and machine learning, so it focuses on providing kinetic modelling primitives, leaving it somewhat up to the user to implement an enzax-friendly statistical model using their favourite modelling framework.

However, enzax does provide some utility functionality specifically focused on statistical modelling, as well as plenty of worked examples, all of which  are documented below.

Users are highly encouraged to post more examples to enzax's wiki: <https://github.com/dtu-qmcm/enzax/wiki>.
